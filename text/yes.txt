ðŸ’ž YAYYYY YOU LOVE ME ðŸ’ž\n\n
My love. I have loved you since the day we started dating.\n\n
Through ups and downs, we've stayed together. You mean the world to me.\n\n
From the start I knew there was something special about you.\n\n
I'm glad we started to get to know each other, now this far into our relationship I wish to keep you forever.\n\n
You have made my days brighter, my nights shorter and my life so much better.\n\n
You mean the world to me.\n
Your smile brightens the days and nights, and your love fills my heart a warmth I can't get enough of.\n\n
